The following theorem associated with `everyOther` is falsifiable:
	∀ {n0.0 : Nat, n0.1 : Nat} . ((((n0.1 + 1) + 1 = n0.0 + 1)) -> ((1 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1) ∧ ((1 : Nat) + n0 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.2 + 1 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0 = n0.2) ∧ ((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1))

Counter-example:
  n = 3 :: Integer
