Solver timeout: frontend/tests/cases/negative/everyOtherBroken.gr:8:1:
Solver timed out with limit of 10000ms while checking the grading of definition `everyOther` with the following theorem:
∀ {n0.0 : Nat, n0.1 : Nat} . (((n0.1 + 1 = n0.2 + 1) ∧ (n0.1 + 1 = n0.1 + 1) ∧ (n0.0 + 1 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.0 + 1 = n0.0 + 1)) -> ((1 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1) ∧ ((1 : Nat) + (n0 * (1 : Nat)) = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.2 + 1 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0 = n0.2) ∧ (n0.2 = n0) ∧ ((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1))
You may want to increase the timeout (see --help).
