Type checking failed: 
Impossible pattern match: frontend/tests/cases/negative/impossiblePat.gr:6:1:
Pattern match in an equation of `last` is impossible as it implies the unsatisfiable condition (0 = n + 1)

Counter example: frontend/tests/cases/negative/impossiblePat.gr:8:1:
The following theorem associated with `last` is falsifiable:
	∀ {n0.0 : Nat} . (((n0.0 + 1 = n + 1)) -> (n0.0 = n0 + 1) ∧ ((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1))

Counter-example:
  n = 0 :: Integer
